## 🆕 Commit Messages

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special format that 
includes a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory, and the **scope** of the header is optional as of **body** and **footer**.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to 
read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

#### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.
In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

#### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature.
* **fix**: A bug fix.
* **docs**: Documentation only changes.
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
* **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.

#### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `test`, `ci`, `algorithm`, `java`, etc...

You can use `*` when the change affects more than a single scope.

#### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

#### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

#### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit closes closing-issues.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.
The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
